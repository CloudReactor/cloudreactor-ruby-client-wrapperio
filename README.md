## Overview

This Ruby gem consists of 2 parts:

1) The CloudReactor API client allows ruby applications to programmatically
   create, monitor, and manage Tasks and Workflows. Most notably, you can start
   and stop Tasks and Workflows by creating Task Executions and
   Workflow Executions.

2) The Wrapper I/O module allows ruby applications to communicate with the
   [CloudReactor wrapper](https://github.com/CloudReactor/cloudreactor-procwrapper)
   which is the parent process.

To install this gem, include:

  gem 'cloudreactor_api_client'

in your `Gemfile`.

See the [CloudReactor landing page](https://www.cloudreactor.io/) to see the
benefits of monitoring and managing your tasks with CloudReactor.

## API client

The API client allows your program to control various entities in CloudReactor,
most notably, Tasks and Workflows. The code and
[documentation](cloudreactor_api_client.md) are generated by
[OpenAPI generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).

To start an existing Task, create a TaskExecution linked to the Task, with a
status of `CloudReactorAPIClient::TaskExecutionStatus::MANUALLY_STARTED`:

```ruby
config = CloudReactorAPIClient::Configuration.new
config.api_key['tokenAuth'] = 'YOUR API KEY'
api_client = CloudReactorAPIClient::ApiClient.new(config)

task = CloudReactorAPIClient::NameAndUuid.new
task.name = 'Sample Task'
task_execution = CloudReactorAPIClient::TaskExecution.new
task_execution.task = task
task_execution.status = CloudReactorAPIClient::TaskExecutionStatus::MANUALLY_STARTED
te_api = CloudReactorAPIClient::TaskExecutionsApi.new(api_client)
te_api.task_executions_create(task_execution)
```

## Wrapper I/O

While running a ruby process that is wrapped by a CloudReactor process wrapper,
you can use `CloudReactorWrapperIO::StatusUpdater` to
send updates about your process to the wrapper. The wrapper will send those
updates to the CloudReactor API server during its next heartbeat.
Updates can include:

* success count
* error count
* skipped count
* expected count
* last status message
* any additional properties that can be serialized into JSON

Updates are communicated via a local UDP socket which means they are
theoretically unreliable. However, in practice, updates are almost always
picked up correctly.

### Example usage

```ruby
# This is necessary even in Rails, due to the module name not matching the
# package name.
require 'cloudreactor_wrapper_io'

# Use the environment variables
# PROC_WRAPPER_ENABLE_STATUS_UPDATE_LISTENER (set to TRUE or FALSE)
# PROC_WRAPPER_STATUS_UPDATE_SOCKET_PORT (set to an integer)
# to determine configuration. These environment variables are typically passed
# to the process wrapper which then passes them on to your process.
status_updater = CloudReactorWrapperIO::StatusUpdater.new()

begin
  status_updater.send_update(
    success_count: 1,
    error_count: 2,
    last_status_message: 'running'
  )
ensure
  status_updater.close()
end
```
